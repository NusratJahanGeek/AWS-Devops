# Lab - 2
## Creating Static Website with Amazon S3

In this lab, I will learn the process of creating a static website by using Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), how to configure an S3 bucket policy, which is required to allow public access.
By the end of this lab, I will hands-on experience with the AWS Management Console and develop a better understanding of the AWS Cloud overall.

## Objective - 1: Create an S3 bucket

The bucket name must be unique within a partition. A partition is a grouping of Regions. 
AWS currently has three partitions: aws (Standard Regions), aws-cn (China Regions), and aws-us-gov (AWS GovCloud (US) Regions).


Configure the S3 bucket as a static website and allow public access.
Add a bucket policy.
Create and upload the website assets.
Test the Amazon S3 static website.
